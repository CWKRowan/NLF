            <p><b>New Life Furniture Bank</b> (NLFB) is Southwest Ohioâ€™s only 
                furniture bank collecting gently used furniture and household 
                items to provide to those in need throughout Greater Cincinnati
                and Northern Kentucky.  We deliver and set-up an <b>entire 
                household of furnishings</b> to families overcoming 
                homelessness, domestic abuse, extreme poverty, and other 
                devastating circumstances.</p>
            <p>We recognize that <b>a home requires more than just four walls.</b>
                A home requires essential furnishings such as beds to sleep on,
                a table & chairs to eat at, a sofa to gather, and other basic 
                household items to <b>transform empty spaces into livable homes.</b></p>
