            <p>Volunteer in our warehouse by sorting and boxing up housewares items 
                like dishes, cups, cookware and linens, so they are ready to get 
                loaded onto our trucks and delivered to people in our community.</p>

            <h3>Delivering Furniture</h3>
            <p>In 2020, NLFB delivered 15,812 pieces of furniture, including 
                1,318 beds to 1,071 households consisting of 1,930 individuals â€“
                nearly half were children who had experienced homelessness.  
                Most were households with a single mother and children.  
                Over 80% reported household earnings of less than $12,000 a year.  
                Having a furnished home restores dignity, brings pride of 
                ownership, adds confidence, and allows families to stabilize 
                while working toward self-sufficiency.</p>

            <h3>Building Furniture</h3>
            <p>We have a woodshop in our warehouse for building essential 
                pieces of furniture like kitchen tables, end tables, book 
                shelves and desks. In the last 3 1/2 years, volunteers have 
                built nearly 1800 furniture pieces, and volunteers are on track
                to reach their ambitious goal of building 1,000 items this year!
                Each piece is skillfully assembled and painted by one of our 
                outstanding volunteers. No experience required.
                Our expert woodworking leaders will work alongside you or 
                your group.</p>
